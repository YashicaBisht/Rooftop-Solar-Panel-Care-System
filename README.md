# Rooftop Solar-Panel Care System
The Rooftop Solar Panel Cleaner is an automated cleaning system designed to maintain optimal efficiency of solar panels by regularly removing dust, dirt, and debris. This project provides a cost-effective and safe alternative to manual cleaning, especially for panels installed in hard-to-reach or high-altitude locations. By automating the cleaning process, it reduces maintenance costs and improves the overall energy output of solar installations.

Features are
Automated cleaning mechanism using motorized brushes.
Optional remote control via Wi-Fi or mobile app.
Supports various panel sizes and configurations.

Components used in this project are
Microcontroller ( ESP32)
servo motors
Microfiber cloth for cleaning mechanism
IR , ultrasonic sensors(for obstacle detection or edge detection)
Relay
Power supply (battery)

Benefits are as follows
Increases solar panel efficiency by reducing dirt-induced power losses.
Reduces manual labor and cleaning risks.
Improves lifespan and reliability of solar panels.

Working of the project 
This is a autonomous robotic system built on a four-wheel robot chassis controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. It is designed to navigate, detect obstacles, and perform cleaning . The robot uses DC motors to move the wheels , IR sensors for edge or line detection, and an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles. A relay module is controlled by the ESP32. It can switch ON/OFF an external load such as a motorized brush.

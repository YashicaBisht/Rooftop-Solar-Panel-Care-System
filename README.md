# Rooftop Solar-Panel Care System
The Rooftop Solar Panel Care System is an automated cleaning system designed to clean solar panels and maintain their efficiency by regularly removing dust, dirt, and debris. By automating the cleaning process, it reduces maintenance costs and improves the overall cleanliness of solar panels.

Features are
Automated cleaning mechanism using cleaning equipment.
Robotic chassis is being controlled through web interface.
Portable


Components used in this project are
Microcontroller ( ESP32)
Motor Driver
DC motors
Microfiber cloth for cleaning mechanism
IR sensor
Relay
Power supply (battery)

Working of the project 
ESP32 is used to control a 4-wheel robotic chassis that moves across the panel surface via user interface. 

The ESP32 activates a cleaning mechanism via a relay which is further connected to DC motor.

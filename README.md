# Rooftop Solar-Panel Care System
The Rooftop Solar Panel Cleaner is an automated cleaning system designed to maintain optimal efficiency of solar panels by regularly removing dust, dirt, and debris. By automating the cleaning process, it reduces maintenance costs and improves the overall energy output of solar installations.

Features are
Automated cleaning mechanism using cleaning mechanism.
Robot chasis is being Controlled bthrough web interface.
Portable


Components used in this project are
Microcontroller ( ESP32)
DC motors
Microfiber cloth for cleaning mechanism
IR sensor
Relay
Power supply (battery)

Working of the project 
ESP32 to controls a 4-wheel robot chassis that moves across the panel surface. 

The ESP32 activates a cleaning mechanism via a relay which is further connected to DC motor.
The robot is also controllable through a user interface
